#Timer app

_Exercise from "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp" by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider_

After coding this project with the instructor I see this template shared by [Eliana] [https://github.com/elibasc/js-timerapp]. I downloaded the template and figured out how HTML, CSS works and JavaScript work flow of Elana's Timer app. So I decided code it again myself.

The problem I solved: While Timer is running you can change the time immediately without waiting the time to the end, pause the time or reset the time.

_Notes: the app doesn't seems to work well on Firefox and Safari, the app is built with setInterval() which lags on some browsers so the countdown takes longer_
